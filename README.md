Welcome to AUXPAD! üéâ 

AUXPAD is an online productivity tool that helps people take better meeting notes. It combines a really good Markdown editor with state of the art speech-to-text technology.

What you will have access to in this repo is part of our speech recognition flow: streaming a audio recording from a placeholder frontend UI to our backend Node.js server.
